# Project_Optimizing_Online_Sports_Retail_Revenue
The project is guided by George, Analytics & Data Science Curriculum Manager at DataCamp to to analyze product data for an online sports retail company using SQL. It focuses on working with numeric, string, and timestamp data using SQL on pricing and revenue, ratings, reviews, descriptions, and website traffic. Besides that, I utilized techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue. 

The report for the project is presented using Jupyter Notebook. You may go for the notebook titled "optimizing_online_sports_retail_revenue" in the above.
